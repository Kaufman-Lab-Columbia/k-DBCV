# k-DBCV

k-DBCV is an efficient python implementation of the density based cluster validation (DBCV) score proposed by Moulavi et al. (2014). 

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
- SciPy
- NumPy
### Installation
k-DBCV can be installed via pip:
```
check back later
```

## Usage
To score clustering scenarios, the following libraries are used:
- scikit-learn
- ClustSim

For visualization:
- matplotlib
 
### DBCV Score
#### Simple Scenario
The half moons dataset simulated from scikit-learn is shown:

</p>

```
DBCV_Score(X,labels)
```
Output: 0.5068928345037831

#### Scenario II
A larger dataset of clusters simulated with Clust_Sim-SMLM is shown:

</p>
 
```
score = DBCV_score(X,labels)
```
Output: 0.6171526846848352

### Extracting Individual Cluster Scores
k-DBCV enables individual cluster score extraction where each cluster is assigned a score without consideration for noise:
Individual Cluster Score = separation-sparseness/max(separation,sparseness)

By default, ind_clust_scores is set to False
```
score, ind_clust_score_array = DBCV_Score(X,labels, ind_clust_scores = True)
```
Individual cluster scores are displayed by color below:

</p>

### Memory cutoff
A memory cutoff is necessary to prevent attempts to score clusters that would exceed available memory. This cutoff should be set dependent on the machine being used. The default is set to a maximum of 25.0 GB. The score will output a -1 if the cutoff would be exceeded, along with an error message. To remove these error messages set batch_mode = True (Default is False).
```
score = DBCV_score(X,labels, memory_cutoff = 25.0)
```
