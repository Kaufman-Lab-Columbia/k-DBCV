# Draft-DBCV

DBCV* is an efficient python implementation of the density based cluster validation (DBCV) score proposed by Moulavi et al. (2014). 

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
- SciPy
- NumPy
### Installation
DBCV* can be installed via pip:
```
pip install ....?
```
or
```
pip install ....?
```

## Usage
To score clustering scenarios, the following libraries are used:
- scikit-learn
- Clust_Sim-SMLM

For visualization:
- matplotlib
 
### DBCV Score
#### Simple Scenario
The half moons dataset simulated from scikit-learn is shown:

```
DBCV_Score(X,labels)
```
Output: 0.5068928345037831

#### Scenario II
More complex clusters simulated with Clust_Sim-SMLM are shown:


```
score = DBCV_Score(X,labels)
```
Output:

### Extracting Individual Cluster Scores
DBCV* enables individual cluster score extraction where each cluster is assigned a score:
Individual Cluster Score = Sep-Sparse/Sep
```
score, ind_clust_score_array = DBCV_Score(X,labels, ind_clust_scores)
```
Individual cluster scores are visualized below:

### Memory cutoff
Currently, DBCV* memory scales with individual cluster sizes. Thus, a memory cutoff is necessary and should be set dependent on the machine being used. The default is set to a maximum of 15000 points allowed in a single cluster. 
```
score = DBCV_Score(X,labels, memory_cutoff = 15000)
```
Output:
```
score = DBCV_Score(X,labels, memory_cutoff = 10)
```
Output:
